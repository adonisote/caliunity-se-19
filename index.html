            <h4>The story</h4>
            <p>
                I started with calisthenics because I wanted to train something
                else different to the gym <br />
                Since the very begining of
            </p>
            <p>
                I loved it since the first day, I notice the rapid improvement
            </p>
            <p>
                Sadly, I got stuck very fast as well. Not being able to progress
                is very demotivating and abandond calisthenics for a while.
            </p>
            <p>
                For my luck, a friend of mine started organizing group workouts.
                Here is where I learnt that the real strength is not in the
                dicipline and the own effort, but in having people who motivate
                you in the most challanging moments of calisthenics.
            </p>
            <p>
                I overcome the pitfall by joining group workouts and asking for
                help. I was lucky enough to be sorrounded with people who where
                very supportive. I just wished that I had this environment since
                the begining of my fitness journey.
