                    &quot;I&quot; started with calisthenics because I wanted to
                    train something else different to the gym <br />
                    Since the very begining of
                </p>
                <p>
                    I loved it since the first day, I notice the rapid
                    improvement
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sadly, I got stuck very fast as well. Not being able to
                    progress is very demotivating and abandond calisthenics for
                    a while.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For my luck, a friend of mine started organizing group
                    workouts. Here is where I learnt that the real strength is
                    not in the dicipline and the own effort, but in having
                    people who motivate you in the most challanging moments of
                    calisthenics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I overcome the pitfall by joining group workouts and asking
                    for help. I was lucky enough to be sorrounded with people
                    who where very supportive. I just wished that I had this
                    environment since the begining of my fitness journey.

                    That is how caliunity came to life. It should be a place for
                    community learning and support in any kind
